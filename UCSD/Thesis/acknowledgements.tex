I would like to thank Professor Jacques Verstraëte for introducing me to the world of mathematical research and for his invaluable guidance over these past two years. His patience and unwavering support—especially during moments when I struggled—have been instrumental in my growth.

I also thank my family for their utmost support in all aspects of my academic journey. Their belief in me has allowed me to focus on my studies and pursue my aspirations without distraction. I would not be where I am today without them.
