\begin{homeworkProblem}
    “The union of two subgroups of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$.” True or False? If true then give a proof and if false then give a counterexample.

    \begin{proof}
      The statement is false. Consider the $D_3$, the groups of symmetries of a triangle, and its subgroups $\{I, F_1\}$, $\{I, F_2\}$, two cyclic subgroups of distinct flips. Since $F_1F_2 = R$, their union $\{I, F_1, F_2\}$ is not closed under the operation of $G$, and thus it's not a subgroup.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}

    Verify that the relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on the set $S$ given.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(b)] $S = \C$, the complex numbers, $a \sim b$ if $|a| = |b|$.
        
        \begin{proof}
            We check each property of a equivalence relation.

            \textbf{Reflexivity:} $|a| = |a|$, and so $a \sim a$, trivial.

            \textbf{Symmetry:} Suppose that $|a| = |b|$, then $|b| = |a|$. Thus, $a \sim b$ imples $b \sim a$.

            \textbf{Transitivity:} Suppose that $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$. Then $|a| = |b| = |c|$, and so $a \sim c$.

            Thus, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Its equivalence classes are sets of complex numbers of the same distance to the origin, namely, circles of different radius centering the origin on the complex plane.
        \end{proof}

        \item[(c)] $S =$ straight lines in the plane, $a \sim b$ if $a, b$ are parallel.
        
        \begin{proof}
            We again check each property of a equivalence relation.

            \textbf{Reflexivity:} $a$ is paralled to itself so $a \sim a$.

            \textbf{Symmetry:} Suppose that $a \sim b$. Then $a, b$ are parallel to each other, and so $b \sim a$. 

            \textbf{Transitivity:} Suppose that $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$. Let $s$ be the slope of $b$. Since $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, the slope of $a, b, c$ are all $s$, and so $a \sim c$.

            Thus, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Its equivalence classes are sets of straight lines with the same slope.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    For each subgroup of $D_4$, list all the left and right cosets.  (Since $D_4$ has many subgroups, it is only necessary to do this up to the obvious symmetries)

    \begin{proof}
        The left and right cosets of $\{I\}$ are all the sets that only contain a non-identity element in $D_4$.

        The left and right cosets of $D_4$ is $D_4$ itself.

        Since $\{I, R_1, R_2, R_3\}$ contains $4$ elements, by the Lagrange Theorem, the only possible left/right cosets of it is $\{I, R_1, R_2, R_3\}$ itself and the rest of the elements $\{F_1, F_2, F_3, F_3\}$, namely, all of the flips.

        For $\{I, F_1\}$, its left cosets are $\{I, F_1\}, \{F_2, R^2\}, \{F_3, R\}, \{F_4, R^3\}$, while while the right cosets are \\ $\{I, F_1\}, \{F_2, R^2\}, \{F_3, R^3\}, \{F_4, R\}$.

        For $\{I, F_2\}$, its left cosets are $\{I, F_2\}, \{F_1, R^2\}, \{F_3, R^3\}, \{F_4, R\}$, while while the right cosets are \\ $\{I, F_2\}, \{F_1, R^2\}, \{F_3, R\}, \{F_4, R^3\}$.

        For $\{I, F_3\}$, its left cosets are $\{I, F_3\}, \{F_1, R^3\}, \{F_2, R\}, \{F_4, R^2\}$, while while the right cosets are \\ $\{I, F_3\}, \{F_1 R\}, \{F_2, R^3\}, \{F_4, R^2\}$.

        For $\{I, F_4\}$, its left cosets are $\{I, F_4\}, \{F_1, R\}, \{F_2, R^3\}, \{F_4, R^2\}$, while while the right cosets are \\ $\{I, F_4\}, \{F_1 R^3\}, \{F_2, R\}, \{F_4, R^2\}$.

        For $\{I, R^2\}$, its left and right cosets are both $\{I, R^2\}, \{R, R^3\}, \{F_1, F_2\}, \{F_3, F_4\}$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    In $\Z_{16}$, write down all the cosets of the subgroup $H = \{[0], [4], [8], [12]\}$.

    \begin{proof}  
        \begin{align*}
            [0] + H &= H \\
            [1] + H &= \{[1], [5], [9], [13]\} \\
            [2] + H &= \{[2], [6], [10], [14]\} \\
            [3] + H &= \{[3], [7], [11], [15]\}
        \end{align*}
        Since $[4] + H = [0] + H = H$, $[a] + H$ repeats the above listed cosets, for all $a \geq 4$.

        Thus, we have obtained all cosets of $H$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    In problem $4$, what is the index of $H$ in $\Z_{16}$?

    \begin{proof}
        As listed in above question, there are $4$ left/right cosets of $H$, and thus $[\Z_{16};H] = 4$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If $aH$ and $bH$ are distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$, are $Ha$ and $Hb$ distinct right cosets of $H$ in $G$?

    \begin{proof}
        No. Consider $D_4$'s subgroup $H = \{I, F_1\}$. From problem 3, we know $F_3H = \{F_3, R\}$ and $R^3H = \{F_4, R_3\}$ are distinct cosets. However $HF_3 = \{F_3, R^3\} = HR^3$ are the same. Thus the statement is disproved.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If $G$ is a finite abelian group and $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are all elements, show that $x = a_1a_2 \dots a_n$ must satisfy $x^2 = e$.

    \begin{proof}
        We first prove that for all $k \geq 1$, $\Pi_{1 \leq j \leq k} a_j = a_k\Pi_{1 \leq j < k} a_j$. Let $y = \Pi_{1 \leq j \leq k} a_j \in G$. Since $G$ is abelian, 
        \begin{gather}
            \Pi_{1 \leq j \leq k} a_j = ya_k = a_ky = a_k\Pi_{1 \leq j < k} a_j.
        \end{gather}

        We now prove that we can rearrange $x = a_1a_2 \dots a_n$ into any ordering by induction on $n$. The base case is trivial. For $n > 1$, suppose we aim to rearrange $x = a_1a_2 \dots a_n$ into some ordering such that $a_n$ is the $l$-th element in the order. We can first take the last $n - l + 1$ elements and apply (1) to move $a_n$ to the $l$-th position. Then, by induction, we can rearrange the first $l - 1$ elements and the last $n - l$ elements into the desired ordering, and thus the statement is proven.

        Since each element has one unique inverse, we can rearrange $x = a_1a_2 \dots a_n$ into $x = a_{m_n}a_{m_{n-1}} \dots a_{m_1}$, such that $a_ia_{m_i} = e$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
            x^2
            &= a_1a_2 \dots a_{n-1}(a_na_{m_n})a_{m_{n-1}} \dots a_{m_1} \\
            &= a_1a_2 \dots a_{n-2}(a_{n-1}a_{m_{n-1}})a_{m_{n-2}} \dots a_{m_1} \\
            &= a_1a_{m_1} \\
            &= e.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If $G$ is of odd order, what can you say about the $x$ in problem $16$?
    
    \begin{proof}
        Since $G$ is of odd order, $G$ cannot have subgroups of order $2$, and thus for all non indentity $a \in G$, $a^2 \neq e$, otherwise $\{e, a\}$ would a a subgroup of order $2$ in $G$. This implies that each non-identity element can be paired with an unique inverse distinct to itself. By the result we obtained in the previous question, we can rearrange $x$ such that each non-identity element in the sequence is next to its inverse. By associativity, each non-identity element in the new ordering would pair up with its neighboring inverse and resolve to $e$, and thus we get $x = e$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let $G$ be a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$, and let $S$ be the set of all distinct right cosets of $H$ in $G$, $T$ the set of all left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Prove that there is a 1-1 mapping of $S$ onto $T$.    

    \begin{proof}
        Consider the function $f: S \rightarrow T$, $f(Hx) = x^{-1}H$, for $x \in G$. Let $Ha, Ha' \in S$, such that $Ha = Ha'$. This implies that $Haa'^{-1} = H$, and so $aa'^{-1} \in H$. Let $h = aa'^{-1}$. We know $a^{-1}h = a^{-1}aa'^{-1} = a'^{-1} \in a^{-1}H$, and thus $f(Ha) = a^{-1}H = a'^{-1}H = f(Ha')$.
        
        We first show $f$ is injective. Let $a, b \in G$, such that $f(Ha) = f(Hb)$. Then, we know $a^{-1}H = b^{-1}H$, and so $ba^{-1}H = H$, which implies $ba^{-1} \in H$. Let $h = ba^{-1} \in H$. We then get $ha = b \in Ha$, and thus $Ha = Hb$. 

        We now show $f$ is surjective. For all $y = bH \in T$, we have $x = Hb^{-1} \in S$, so that $f(x) = bH$.
        
        Therefore, $f$ is a 1-1 mapping of $S$ onto $T$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If $aH = bH$ forces $Ha = Hb$ in $G$, show that $aHa^{-1} = H$ for every $a \in G$.
    
    \begin{proof}
        Let $b \in aH$. Then, $aH = bH$, which forces $b \in Hb = Ha$. Thus, $aH \subseteq Ha$, so $aHa^{-1} \subseteq H$. We now show that $|aHa^{-1}| \geq |H|$. Define $f: aHa^{-1} \rightarrow H$ as $f(x) = a^{-1}xa$.

        Let $x = aha^{-1}, x' = ah'a^{-1}$, for some $h, h'$, such that $x = x'$. By cancellation, we know $h = h'$. Then, $f(x) = a^{-1}xa = h = h' = a^{-1}x'a = f(x')$, and so $f$ is well defined.

        For each $y \in H$, we have $x = aya^{-1}$, such that $f(x) = a^{-1}(aya^{-1})a = y$. Thus, $f$ is surjective, and so $|aHa^{-1}| \geq |H|$. Since $aHa^{-1} \subseteq H$ and $|aHa^{-1}| \geq |H|$, we have $aHa^{-1} = H$.
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\newpage

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If in a group $G$, $aba^{-1} = b^i$, show that $a^rba^{-r} = b^{i^r}$ for all positive integers $r$.
    \begin{proof}
        We proceed by induction on $r$. The base case $aba^{-1} = b^i$ is already given. For $r > 1$, we get $a^rba^{-r} = a \cdot a^{r - 1}ba^{-(r - 1)} \cdot a^{-1}$. By induction, 
        \begin{align*}
            a \cdot a^{r - 1}ba^{-(r - 1)} \cdot a^{-1}
            &= ab^{i^{r - 1}}a^{-1} \\
            &= \underbrace{aba^{-1}aba^{-1} \dots aba^{-1}}_{i^{r-1} \text{ times}} \\
            &= (b^{i})^{i^{r - 1}} \\
            &= b^{i^r},
        \end{align*}
        and we are done.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    If in $G$, $a^5 = e$ and $aba^{-1} = b^2$, find $o(b)$ if $b \neq e$.

    \begin{proof}
        Since $aba^{-1} = b^2$, by the result we obtained from the previous question, we know $a^5ba^{-5} = b = b^{2^5}$, and thus we get $b^{2^5 - 1} = e$. Since $2^5 - 1 = 31$ is a prime number and $b \neq e$, there are no positive $r < 31$ such that $b^r = e$, and so $o(b) = 31$.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $n$, and $a_1, \dots, a_n$ its elements. Let $x = a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Show that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)] If $G$ has exactly one element $b \neq e$ such that $b^2 = e$, then $x = b$.
        \begin{proof}
            In problem $7$, we proved that we can rearrange $x = a_1a_2\dots a_n$ into any ordering. For all $a_i^2 \neq e$, we rearrange $a_1a_2\dots a_n$ such that $a_i$ is next it its inverse, which allows each $a_i$ to pair up with its neighboring inverse and resolve to $e$. Thus, the sequence becomes $x = be = e$, and we are done.
        \end{proof}

        \item[(b)] If $G$ has more than one element $b \neq e$ such that $b^2 = e$, then $x = e$.
         
        \begin{proof}
            idk bro.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    “Every countable group is finitely generated.” True or False? If true then give a proof and if false then give a counterexample.

    \begin{proof}
        Consider $\Q$ under addition. We know $\Q$ is countable. Suppose for sake of contradiction that there exists a finite set $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\} \subset \Q$, $s_i = \frac{a_i}{b_i}$ for $a_i, b_i \in \Z - \{0\}$, such that $\langle S \rangle = \Q$. Let $b = \Pi_{s_i \in S} b_i$. Then, all elements in $\langle S \rangle$ can be represented in the form of $\frac{c_i}{b}$, $c_i \in \Z$. However, we can find $\frac{p}{q} \in \Q$, such that $p, q \in \N$, $\gcd(q, b) = 1$, so that $\frac{p}{q}$ cannot be represented in the form of $\frac{c_i}{b}$, contradiction. Therefore, $\Q$ under addition is a countable group that cannot be finitely generated.
    \end{proof}
